# NFTMarketplace

I created this marketplace using React, Node-js, Solidity, Hardhat, Web3Modal, MetaMask, Ipfs and Ether.

# How to start the aplication: 

   -First, you need to install the project's dependencies. Open your terminal and navigate to your project folder, then run the following command: npm install
   -To create a local Ethereum network for development, you can use Hardhat. Run the following command to start a local node:npx hardhat node(Keep this terminal window open, as it will be your local blockchain.)
   -You need a crypto wallet to interact with the local network. Use your preferred crypto wallet (like MetaMask) and connect it to the local network you just started. You'll need to import an account from your Hardhat local node into your wallet.
   -Open a new terminal window and navigate to your project folder. Run the following command to deploy your smart contract to the local network: npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   -Now, start your React application by running: npm run dev
   -Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see your application's landing page.
